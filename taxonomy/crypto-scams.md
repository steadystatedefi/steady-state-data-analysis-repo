    -   * [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering) raises money without a legitmate project launch or roadmap. Typically well-known investors are tied to the project's name to get credibility and public trust.
    -   * e.g. [CentraTech](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/icos/centra-tech-founder-sentenced-to-prison-for-25m-ico-scam/), a cryptocurrency founded in 2017 by Robert Farkas, Sohrab Sharma, and Raymond Trapani was abruptly charged by U.S. authorities. The founders were federally prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice for a fraudalent ICO scam which procured over $25 million worth of investor money. The project had 0 viability in attributing to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The project was advertised by boxer Floyd Mayweather and music producer, DJ Khaled who were fined for participating in the scam ICO scheme.
    
-   Fake Hacks
    -   * Project gets hacked from an insider who shares profit with the project team.
    -   * e.g. South Korean exchange [Bithumb](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/30/crypto-exchange-bithumb-hacked-for-13-million-in-suspected-insider-job/) gets hacked by insider for $13 million.
    
-   Fake Wallets
    -   * Wallet software that allows the scammer to access private keys, so the coins can be stolen from the user.
    -   * e.g. Hackers steal $40 million by leveraging two-factor authenication codes and API tokens on [Binance](https://www.wired.com/story/hack-binance-cryptocurrency-exchange/) cryptocurrency exchange.
    
-   Ponzi Schemes
    -   * New entrants or investors are promised good returns while old investors are paid with new investors' money.
    -   * e.g. In 2016, Bitconnect, a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency launched. The project proposed 40% monthly returns for investors lending their Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on it's platform. Bitconnect was exposed as a ponzi scheme by investors and ridiculed by creator of Litecoin, Charlie Lee as well as Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum for it's spurious promises.
    
-   Pump & Dumps
    -   * Illiquid coins are bought cheaply by fraudsters then hyped on social media and sold at a higher price to new investors. 
    -   * e.g. During the Bitcoin bull run of 2021, [Elon Musk](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/dogecoin-a-victim-of-pump-and-dump-scheme-by-elon-musk-says-analyst-1030522149) comically shills Dogecoin on Twitter, SNL, and various media platforms. The events sparked a particular interest from new and na√Øve investors who have never participated in the cryptocurrency market before. 
    - Typically, high-profile celebrities endorse a token because they are paid to do so or they are participating in a classic [pump and dump](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pumpanddump.asp) scheme where new investors buy the targeted token at a high price while old investors sell off before an imminent downturn.
    
-   Scam mining 
    -   * Claims that investors will earn profused cryptocurrency but key information such as diffculty increases and gas fees are not disclosed.

Public trust in the cryptocurrency mining services on mobile devices have subsided because of scam mining schemes. 

-   Spoof ICOs
    -   * Clones of real ICO websties made with the scammer's public key instead of the legitimate public key.
    -   * e.g. In 2018, the SEC published a fake ICO website to show investors how easy it is to fall for Spoof ICO websites claiming to offer legitimate cryptocurrency projects. The project was dubbed ["HoweyCoins"](https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html), which claimed to have a 7%-15% annual growth rate.
